# DSA-Problems-Python-Solutions
Repo with my solutions for all the DSA-based puzzles that I have solved so far

- All solutions are in Python
- Each .py file corresponds to a solution
- The related question and any additional information are added as comments in the beginning of each file
- The .py files might throw errors when compiling locally but they all work fine on leetcode IDE. I have only added the solutions that are **accepted** in leetcode
- Files have the following naming convention: \[(Leetcode) difficulty]\<space\>\<Problem title\>.py. The difficulty code is H - Hard, M - Medium and E - Easy problems.
